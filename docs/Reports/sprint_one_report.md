## What's New (User Facing)
 * Login Page
 * Registration Page
 * Matching Algorithm

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, we thoroughly planned out our desired final product, and subsequently discussed what product we wanted to deliver for the first sprint. We assigned tasks to each team member with clear expectations of the libraries, languages, and tools that we would use to make our integration (sprint two) as seamless as possible. We developed a simple matching algorithm to match users with one another, we set up our docker environment, we developed a straightforward Flask API, and we designed a simple UI for the homepage as well as the login and registration pages.
## Unfinished Work
We had hoped to have a login/registration mechanism completed this sprint, but we ran out of time. Instead, we completed half of this process by completing the UI for these pages, and we plan on implementing the features to store user login information and authorization during sprint 2. We have made this clear on our kanban board, assigning the issue to sprint two.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * All of the items that we planned to get done for the sprint were finished
  * Communicated well
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Start earlier, we started development fairly late into the sprint, more could have been done if we started earlier
   * Meeting more often to stay more on page with one another
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Wrapper MatchRoomate class
   * SQL Database for users
   * Add to the main menu and add functionality
   * Integrate different parts
