# Sprint 2 Report

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Effective matching
 * User Database
 * Better login features

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, we focused heavily on the main compnent of our app: matching. Although we had a matching algorithm already created last sprint, we had nothing to put in it. Now, we are able to create an infinite amoount of questions, choose an answer style, and have numerical values assigned to those answers in order to computate compatibility. Additionally, we knew that we needed a way to store user data. Whether this is storing their emails, matches, or even just their answers, our new database gives us a reference pont and something we can go back to. 

## Unfinished Work
One thing we really wanted to get done this sprint was have the ability to actually use the UI to answer questions. the backend elemnts are are functional and effective, but we were having issues updating the UI. Right now we're sitting at about 75% complettion. WIth the updated UI we would be at 90. That's why it's a major goal for our next sprint.
