# Frontend - React + Flask

This frontend application combines a React frontend with a Flask backend server to serve the built React files.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - React source files
  - `App.jsx` - Main React application component
  - `Login.jsx` - Login component
  - `Registration.jsx` - Registration component  
  - `RoommateProfile.jsx` - Roommate profile component
  - `*.css` - Component stylesheets
- `public/` - Static files for React
- `build/` - Built React application (generated by `npm run build`)
- `app.py` - Flask server to serve the React app
- `build_and_run.sh` - Script to build and run the application

## Setup and Running

### Option 1: Using the build script (Recommended)
```bash
./build_and_run.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual steps
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## How it works

1. The React app is built into the `build/` directory
2. Flask serves the built React files as static content
3. The Flask app includes:
   - Static file serving for React assets
   - Catch-all routing for React Router (if needed)
   - API endpoints (currently `/api/hello`)

## Accessing the Application

Once running, the application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:8000
- API endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/hello

## Development

For development, you can run the React development server separately:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React dev server on port 3000, while the Flask server can run on port 8000 for API endpoints.
